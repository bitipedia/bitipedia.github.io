There are many articles on places like http://reddit.com/r/btc covering important issues in Bitcoin scaling - but it can be difficult for people to get an overview of the discussion by reading a bunch of posts and threads.

Also, many important articles about Bitcoin are published in just one language - and people who don't speak that language might have a hard time getting involved in the dicussion. 

This site http://bitipedia.github.io is intended to help provide a multilingual platform for translating important articles about Bitcoin - focusing on _on-chain_ scaling.

### Contributing translators are welcome! 

Let's help spread the word about the important issues facing Bitcoin - in particular, _on-chain_ scaling.

We welcome translators and proofreaders who have a good understanding of Bitcoin, and who can either provide new translations (or proofread and improve existing translations) of important articles on Bitcoin.

### It's easy to get involved!

To contribute, you can send a private message to u/bitipedia on Reddit, or (for more security) - or you can set up an email account on tutanota.de, and send a (priavate) email message to bitipedia@tutanota.de - or you can simply post an issue on the GitHub repo for this site, here: https://github.com/bitipedia/bitipedia.github.io/issues

Large and small contributions are welcome. For example, you can translate an entire original article yourself - or you can proofread and improve an existing article already published here.

This is a new, evolving effort, and input is welcome from everyone who wants to help Bitcoin scale _on-chain_.
