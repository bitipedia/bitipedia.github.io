English (en) : a multilingual wiki for translating important articles about Bitcoin - focusing on _on-chain_ scaling

Español (es) : un wiki multilingüe para traducir artigos importantes sobre Bitcoin - centrado en escalabilidade _en cadena_

### Contributing translators are welcome! 

Let's help spread the word about the important issues facing Bitcoin - in particular, _on-chain_ scaling.

We welcome translators and proofreaders who have a good understanding of Bitcoin, and who can either provide new translations (or proofread and improve existing translations) of important articles on Bitcoin.

### It's easy to get involved!

To contribute, please send a private message to u/bitipedia on Reddit, or (for more security), you can set up an email account on tutanota.de, and send a (priavate) email message to bitipedia@bitcoin.de.

Be sure to mention some articles about Bitcoin which you are interested in translating (or existing articles already published here which you can proofread and improve).
