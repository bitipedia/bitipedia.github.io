### A multilingual wiki for translating important articles about Bitcoin - focusing on _on-chain_ scaling

There are many articles on places like http://reddit.com/r/btc covering important issues in Bitcoin scaling - but it can be difficult for people to get an overview of the discussion by reading a bunch of posts and threads.

Also, many important articles about Bitcoin are published in just one language - and people who don't speak that language might have a hard time getting involved in the dicussion. 

This site http://bitipedia.github.io is intended to help provide a multilingual platform for translating important articles about Bitcoin - with a special focus on _on-chain_ scaling.

### New contributors are welcome! 

If you can help translate or proofread articles about Bitcoin and _on-chain_ scaling, then you get involved to help spread the word about Bitcoin _on-chain_ scaling.

### There's different ways to get involved!

Right now there's a few ways you can get involved - and we can always add more in the future, depending on people's preferences.

- You can send a private message to u/bitipedia on Reddit

- You can set up an email account on tutanota.de, and send an (encrypted) email message to bitipedia@tutanota.de 

- You can post an Issue on the GitHub repo for this site, here: https://github.com/bitipedia/bitipedia.github.io/issues

Be sure to mention something you'd be interested in doing - eg, translating a particular article, improving an existing translation, or any other iedas you might to help inform people about _on-chain_ Bitcoin scaling.

This is a new effort and it could evolve depending on people's interests.

Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!
